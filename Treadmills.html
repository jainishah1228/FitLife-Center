    <h2>Treadmills</h2>
    <img src="img/Treadmills.jpg" alt="Treadmills" style="width:500px;height:400px;">
    <p>
        A treadmill is a device generally for walking, running or climbing while 
        staying in the same place. treadmills are not used to harness power, but 
        as exercise machines for running or walking in one place. Rather than the 
        user powering the mill, the machine provides a moving platform with a wide 
        conveyor belt driven by an electric motor or a flywheel. The belt moves to 
        the rear, requiring the user to walk or run at a speed matching that of the 
        belt. The rate at which the belt moves is the rate of walking or running. 
        Thus, the speed of running may be controlled and measured. The more expensive, 
        heavy-duty versions are motor-driven (usually by an electric motor). The simpler, 
        lighter, and less expensive versions passively resist the motion, moving only when 
        walkers push the belt with their feet.  
    </p>
    
    <h2>Specifications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Belt size: For running, the belt should be at least 48 inches long and 18 
            inches wide. If you are over 6 feet tall, you would need at least a 52-inch 
            belt for walking and a 54-inch belt for running.</li>
        <li>Control panel: It should be within reach and simple to use.</li>
        <li>Maximum weight rating: This is a consideration if you are a larger person, 
            and it is also an indication of the sturdiness of the treadmill. Look at the 
            maximum user weight rating (which is optimistic) and subtract about 50 pounds 
            for a realistic figure.</li>
        <li>Speed: If you plan on running, get a treadmill that goes up to 10 mph or higher.</li>
        <li>Stability: The treadmill shouldn't shake when you run or walk on it and the frame 
            should remain stable</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Advantages</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Enable the user to set up an exercise regime indoors that can be adhered to 
            irrespective of the weather.</li>
        <li>Treadmills have programmes such that the user can simulate terrains, 
            e.g. rolling hills, to provide accurate, programmed, exercise periods.</li>
        <li>User progress such as distance, calories burned, and heart rate can be tracked.</li>
    </ul>
