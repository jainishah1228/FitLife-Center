    <h2>Squat Stand</h2>
    <img src="img/Squat Stand.jpg" alt="Squat Stand" style="width:500px;height:400px;">
    <p>A squat is a strength exercise in which the trainee lowers their hips 
        from a standing position and then stands back up. During the descent of a 
        squat, the hip and knee joints flex while the ankle joint dorsiflexes; conversely 
        the hip and knee joints extend and the ankle joint plantarflexes when standing up.
        Squats are considered a vital exercise for increasing the strength and size of the 
        lower body muscles as well as developing core strength.The squat is one of the three 
        lifts in the strength sport of powerlifting, together with the deadlift and the bench 
        press. It is also considered a staple exercise in many popular recreational exercise 
        programs.
